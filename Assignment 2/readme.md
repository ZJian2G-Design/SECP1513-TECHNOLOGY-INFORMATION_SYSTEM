# My Reflection
Hi everyone. My name is Seah Zhang Jian. My reflection on the entire experience, I realized that while UTM digital center offer tremendous convenience, there is always looking for improvement in balancing with user-friendly design. 
Making systems faster, more intuitive, and less prone to glitches would not only enhance satisfaction but also build greater trust in digital platforms. This experience reaffirmed how vital it is to focus on the technical aspects to create an effective digital services. 
Overall, the experience I have is how UTM digital services can significantly improve accessibility and convenience, yet also underscored the importance of maintaining a digital system for a smoother UTM students journey.
