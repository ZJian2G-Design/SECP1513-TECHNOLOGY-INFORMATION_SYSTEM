# My Reflection
The talk has given me the real picture of how the industry is working with the requirements and skills that are needed. The speaker shared his experience that resonates deeply in my mind, especially the idea that foundational knowledge is far more valuable than simply knowing a specific programming language. Through this talk, that really helps me prepare myself early so that I could meet the requirements and skills that the industries needed in the future.
